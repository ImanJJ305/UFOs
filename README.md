## Overview of Project

### Purpose
    The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic webpage that allows UFO enthusiatsts the ability to gather information on UFO sightings within McMinnville, Oregon and other areas. This is intended to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time to analyze the data.

## Results

### Project Use Case
    - This resource will allow users to filter UFO sightings by a specific date, city, state, country, or shape. For example if they would like view the sightings from 1/1/2010 they will be able to do so by adding the date to the search bar. The viewers will be able to filter the data provided by one criteria or multiple different criterias to gather the information desired. 
    
## Summary
    One way to improve this project would be to include additional filters regarding the duration and comments providing further details on the sightings to allow viewers to find information on what occured during the sighting to find similar occurances. Another way to improve the site would be to include more recent data or use an API to automatically pull newer sightings into the page.
